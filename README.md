Creating a PHP-based website as a portfolio with a register login, CMS Admin panel Blog area, Post area. The main index.php is still under consideration what needs to be done and the GIS sector will be the leaflet web map application.

The website uses mainly PHP 8.1 including Html and CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the burger drop-down menu, reveal animation. The Web Map Application uses mainly Leaflet JavaScript library with Html and CSS. The website uses the PostgreSQL database as well

More sectors and ideas will be added soon.
The login and register areas are already done, the next step will be some authentication requests and forgotten passwords,s, etc. Once is done the process will be focused on the GIS sector and Admin panel for manipulation posts etc.
